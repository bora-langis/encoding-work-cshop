# encoding-work-cshop
AHK script for data entry work

I don't think this thing will be useful to anyone but me, however I am glad to have my first repo!

## what it do?
I use this for encoding, and for my data entry work. Also I'm learning git and github. I'll provide a more detailed wiki and put here in the readme some useful snippets
