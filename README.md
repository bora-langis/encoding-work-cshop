AHK script for data entry work

I don't think this thing will be useful to anyone but *me*, however I am glad to have my first repo!

## what it do?
I use this for encoding, and for my data entry work. Also *I'm learning git and github*. I'll provide a more detailed wiki and put here in the readme some useful snippets

## workflow
Since I use this script mainly for ***data entry***, the text editor that I use is **notepad++**. This script provides a few hotkeys to add html elements such as **bold** and *italic* and a function to create a list.

Also, *hotstrings* are used a lot for data entry purposes. The main problem may arise from the fact that all keys were made using an ***italian*** keyboad. So, if someone is going to use this... they are going to have to edit the binding as they may not make any sense on you current layout.
